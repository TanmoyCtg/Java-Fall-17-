# Java-Fall-17-
Hi, I am joy.Student of a American International university Bangladesh(AIUB).I take java in my fall semester. I saved all my semester and personal code here. I also describe how i solve or write this code. So if anyone interested to change my code, you can and you may also add your code.

Introduction
I never programmed in java. Java is pure Object oriented language. My course teacher is really great. I really like java now. Day to day life, I try to explore java. 

Java is a programming language. Java is class-based, object-oriented. That means in java what you write, you must need a class and then you need object. What is object and class I will discuss it later.

Inventor: James Gosling
